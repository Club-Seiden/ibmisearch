ibmisearch is a static website that allows you to search hundreds of IBM i specific links.

Feel free to make PRs to improve the site, it's design, how the search works - whatever!

## Adding more links.

* Create a pull-request over the `data.json` file and follow the format for adding links.
* Open an issue with the links and I will get around to adding them!
